----Design of Program----

This program is designed in a friendly user way. A popup window appears
with a welcoming message and asks the user if he/she wants to proceed. If the user
hits no, a goodbye window will appear and the user will close it. If the user
hits yes, another window (JFrame) will appear and ask the use to enter the
required information.

Enter the start and end date of the vacation. The user is asked to check the box
whether or not he/she wants to rent a boat optionally. If the user checks no, the boat
options will disable. If the user unchecks no, the boat options will enable back. If the
user checks yes, the boat options will stay enabled and the user will have to enter the
dates he/she wants to rent the boat.

At the bottom, the total balance for the stay will be displayed and updated according
to the information user entered.

3) I predict that since this is a college database, there will be many colleges
registered in this field. I think there should be indexes for the college field
and particulary for the ID, LID since they are foreign keys to a lot of tables.

I also think that we should add a FACULTY table and the courses they teach since
it is also part of a student registration. I would make the faculty id a primary
key and a foreign key in many tables, especially in COURSE and USER.

My 3rd suggestion would be to add some kind of function
which calculates the total amount a specific student must pay. For example,
one student registers many types for different classes, obviously he/she will
have to pay for each class seperately. It would be really nice if there was an
option to display the total balance due for a student.

My 4th and last suggestion would be to make a DEADLINE table. The deadline table
would have information about important deadlines, and also a deadline function
which would display if a specific student didn't meet the deadline.
